# dSprites-Warm-start-from-VAE-trained-with-supervision

## (Supervised) Regression between x (image) and z (5-dim true factors, each [-1,+1]-scaled/normalized)


### 1) Setup (brief)
- The same encoder model as FactorVAE for x -> z regression
- The same decoder model as FactorVAE for z -> x regression


### 2) Latent traversal

4 examples

  [ x | z1 | z2 | z3 | z4 | z5 ]
